# At War with WAR: Applying Machine Learning to Evaluate Baseball Players Contribution to Their Team

We sought to address which qualities (statistical measures) in a position-player are the most important in determining their value to the team. In our solution, we would see the relative importance of each of our statistical measures (BA, OBP, ect.).

We measure the accuracy of our model by using team statistics to predict the number of games a team will win in a season. We then compare the predicted wins to the actual wins for each team to measure the performance of our model.
